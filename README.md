## General info
This project is a simple booking application. The project implements the ability to book accommodation for a certain period of time, as a result of which the selected rooms will not be available for booking. The hotel database was created by ourselves, so to save time, there are only 4 cities in the database - London, Paris, Prague and Rome, and the room numbers, their names and number in each hotel are identical. Authorization using _jwt token_ is also implemented. The application was created primarily to improve my practical skills and to better absorb the material I have learned.
